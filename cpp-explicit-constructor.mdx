# Explicit Constructor

_The `explicit` specifier has been extended since c++17, this paragraph only covers its usage with constructors._

The `explicit` specifier is used to demand the compiler not treat a constructor as converting constructor. To understand what the converting constructor is and how it is used, assume we have following existing class definition:

```clike
class RGBA
{
private:
    // ... members

public:
    RGBA(const uint8_t red, const uint8_t green, const uint8_t blue, const uint8_t alpha = 255)
        : m_red{red}, m_green{green}, m_blue{blue}, m_alpha{alpha}
    {
		// ... constructor
    }

	// generate debug outputs
    std::string debug_string() const;
};
```

However for a certain renderer, alpha channel isn't supported and will be ignored in its `fill_something` method. To avoid confuse callers by accidently specifying the alpha value, or considering losing of alpha as a bug, we decided to add a new class `RGB` which doesn't have the alpha channel, and use it in the related method.
