# Explicit Constructor

_The `explicit` specifier has been extended since c++17, this paragraph only covers its usage with constructors._

The `explicit` specifier is used to demand the compiler not treat a constructor as converting constructor. To understand what the converting constructor is and how it is used, assume we have following existing class definition:

```clike
class RGBA
{
private:
    // ... members

public:
    RGBA(const uint8_t red, const uint8_t green, const uint8_t blue, const uint8_t alpha = 255)
    {
		// ... more initialization
    }

	// generate debug outputs
    std::string debug_string() const;
};
```

However for a certain renderer, alpha channel isn't supported and will be ignored in its `fill_something` method. To avoid confuse callers by accidently specifying the alpha value, or considering losing of alpha as a bug, we decided to add a new class `RGB` which doesn't have the alpha channel, and use it in the related method, which is defined as

```clike
class RGB
{
private:
    // ... members

public:
    RGB(const RGBA& rgba)
    {
        std::cout << "drop the alpha channel from " << rgba.debug_string() << std::endl;
		// ... more initialization
    }
};

void fill_something(const RGB& rgb)
{
    // fill something but doesn't support the alpha channel
}
```

Thus a caller of the `fill_something` is supposed to have a view that the alpha channel will be ignored by writing:
