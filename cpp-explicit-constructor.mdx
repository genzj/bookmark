# Explicit Constructor

_The `explicit` specifier has been extended since c++17, this paragraph only covers its usage with constructors._

The `explicit` specifier is used to demand the compiler not treat a constructor as converting constructor. To understand what the converting constructor is and how it is used, assume we have following existing class definitions:

```plaintext
class RGBA
{
private:
    // ... members

public:
    RGBA(const uint8_t red, const uint8_t green, const uint8_t blue, const uint8_t alpha = 255)
        : m_red{red}, m_green{green}, m_blue{blue}, m_alpha{alpha}
    {
    }

    [[nodiscard]] std::string debug_string() const
    {
        std::stringstream s;
        s << "r: " << static_cast<int>(m_red) << " g: " << static_cast<int>(m_green) << " b: " << static_cast<int>(m_blue) << " a: " << static_cast<int>(m_alpha) << std::endl;
        return s.str();
    }
};
```
